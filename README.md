# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the odin project. In this project, I will showcase what I have learned about html basics.

This project is about recipes where I will provide the link to some of the recipes.

At the end of this project, I will have guaranteed myself some basic html skills such as: setting up the html boilerplate, what goes inside head and body tag, some elements regarding texts, how to add links and images, and also about some of the semantic tags.

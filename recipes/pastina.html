        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chef John's chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian grandma, a comfort food that will, quite literally, change your mood. You can make this simple soup with a fortified broth if you have the time, or simply use off-the-shelf chicken broth for the 15-minute version.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup stelline pastina, or other pastina</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed.</li> 
           <li>Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes.</li> 
           <li>Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and grated cheese. Stir constantly until butter disappears.</li> 
           <li>Ladle pastina into hot bowls, top with more freshly ground black pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil.</li> 
        </ol>
